    This document was designed for the course \courselfocs{} and should cover
    the most important topics. On the one hand it should provide a guideline
    to the contents and on the other hand it introduces the reader to the
    foundations of computer science. Please be aware that this script does
    not cover concepts, implementations and ideas in such a detail as it is
    required in economy and science. This document provides a focus on
    \emph{foundations} of computer science.
